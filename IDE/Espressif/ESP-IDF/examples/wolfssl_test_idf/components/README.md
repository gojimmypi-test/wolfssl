# wolfssl_test_idf components

The wolfSSL component should *not* be installed here.

This example project tests the condition of having wolfSSL installed
*in* the Espressif ESP-IDF [components directory](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components).

The recommended method is to use a local component as shown in
the [template example](../template/README.md).
